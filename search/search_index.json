In this repository, I post some meta stuff, such as Discord servers, links, archives, etc. The docs and the repository is still work-in-progress. You can contribute if you want to. Black MIDI Meta Black MIDI Meta is a repository for Black MIDI meta stuff. The main repository is on https://github.com/Hans5958/Black-MIDI-Meta ( short link ).

You can read the docs on https://hans5958.github.io/Black-MIDI-Meta ( short link ). Domino English Translation Domino is MIDI editor that is used for creating MIDI songs/musics. Domino is used by various blackers in the Black MIDI ecosystem. Since Domino is an abandonware, and it's original language is Japanese, many people tried to translate it using resource editing tools. Some of it are outdated, while others are incomplete. This repository is made to unify the translations made by community, while trying to complete it for easier usage. You can visit the repository on https://github.com/Hans5958/Domino-English-Translation/ . List of Largest MIDIs This is a list for the large MIDI songs that the community has ever made. This list was actually long abandoned by wiki contributors, so there are lots of MIDIs that's not on the list. Because of that, I try to maintain it as long as I can. The list has developed from as small as 124 songs to as big as over 300 songs. The update is monthly and you can submit MIDIs by contacting me in any way you can, such as Discord or the wiki page. You can read more info in here . Otherwise, you can visit the Google Drive spreadsheet in https://px.tru.io/r/BMLL ( direct link ) or check the list on the wiki page here .

It is based on the wiki page . Contributions are appreciated, especially the original title from the blacker, missing fields, like note intesity, size, source, etc, and finding new songs. You can view the spreadsheet in the frame below or in here . Background There are a lot of MIDIs that are undocumented, so I tried to put it on the list. The list has developed from 124 songs into more than 200 songs from various blackers and creators. This spreadsheet is created because of the page protection on the said wiki page. Even if the page is unlocked, MediaWiki tables suck, so I'll just keep it. Methodology The methodology of adding this MIDIs is listed below. The blackers/creators must be known. The methods could be, but not limited to, the MIDI is played by a person with high reputation on Black MIDI (ex. BMT), or it can be found on the first page on the YouTube search. The blacked songs must have any evidence and it's not fabricated and using the original blacker video if possible. One example of fabrication is PipiraMine's video of an April Fools MIDI that is created on Ultralight MIDI Player. Even though it is not real, the note counter is faked. Troll editions are mostly accepted. The title will be used is the ones that the blacker named. This to avoid any confusion by original naming of the song. It might be controversial. Note counts must be stated, even as an aproximate, and only be listed with a minimum of ten (10) million notes. Sizes are inserted using maximum of three (3) significant numbers. For example, 25,1 MB, 203 MB, 1,64 GB, 56,4 GB, 592 GB, etc. 20 MB, 2 GB, etc is fine. Revisions/versions/updates are valid if there it is not updated after two months or a major update. All merges are listed with \"[merger] and others\". The song must be in the MIDI (.mid) form. No programs, such as 93 trilion MIDI generator. It can be compressed. Some songs are removed from the list due to the source has lost or just hidden. (look Lost Songs) Author Aliases AdrianMR is also known as Adrian M.

I hope you guys don't forget about this. There are really less songs that is made over the last two months, either it is less active or I'm just being lazy and school work is a lot By the way, we've finally reached the 400 songs milestone ! 13 new songs, from 391 to 404 , here are the few. A Shattered Heart 2.0 and CyberStorm by The Romanticist C418 - Sweden (Caution and Crisis Remix) by Edenathan256 Some songs by Trainer Lidya or Trainer LOLXD Some lag testers and this Fornite spam MIDI for some reason. You may contribute by correcting mistakes, suggesting songs, etc. Thanks for reading! Click here to see the message on Discord. Click here to see the changelog. August 2019 Update (12 September 2019) Here's the update. Sorry for the huge delay, the list is done weeks ago but school somehow kept me busy at these times to upload it. It's such a pain. Also, I'm focusing at other things. 13 new songs, from 378 to 391 , some of which are... Ouranos by HDSQ and The Romanticist Ievan's Polka Infinite Star Wars and War of Sky City by Charile Yan and ooo 000. Various versions of YIAY Lag Tester by me and AwesomeGamer89 By the way, Ievan's Polka Infinite Star Wars became is now the largest non-experimental MIDI , while Happy Theme of DEATH V10 is the largest legit MIDI . The reason why is most of Ievan's Polka Infinity Star Wars notes has no note-off event. Also, the limit of the legit MIDI is estimated as 46,9 trillion notes, because each note need to have a note-on event and a note-off event. Just like last month, you may contribute by correcting mistakes, suggesting songs, etc. Thanks for reading! Click here to see the message on Discord. Click here to see the changelog. July 2019 Update (30 July 2019) Another update, I actually still have a lot of pending songs but I'm afraid that I'm out of schedule, so here it is. I've added 45 songs, making the current count of the list is 378 songs from 333 songs. Some of the additions are... Forgotten Cat series by Palacat Moskau by Carlos S. M. Other versions of Ra Ra Rasputin by Carlos S. M. I've still got some songs on the pending list, such as the newly released Ouranos by HDSQ and The Romaticist and Ievan's Polka Infinite Star Wars by Charile Yan and ooo 000. These, along with others, will be added on the next update, hopefully. Just like last month, you may contribute by correcting mistakes, suggesting songs, etc. Thanks for reading! Click here to see the message on Discord. Click here to see the changelog. June 2019 Update (28 June 2019) 2 minutes before midnight... It's time for another update. Just like last month, it's kind of a lame update. Still, I will try to be consistent to do it monthly, in minimum. I've added 21 songs, making the current count of the list is 333 songs from 312 songs. Some of the additions are... Lots of TheDipperPinez27 songs, most of them are low-quality though. SmousPC by AdrianMR Scarlet Zone by Carlos S. M. Ra Ra Rasputin by Carlos S. M. ...and I've changed the Happy Theme of Death links as per request. Finally, you may contribute by correcting mistakes, suggesting songs, etc. Speaking of the wiki page, I got admin rights and now able to push updates by myself. This is epic. Alright, thanks for reading! Click here to see the message on Discord. Click here to see the changelog. May 2019 Update (30 May 2019) Hey, another update. To be fair, this is the one of the lazy updates that I ever done on this. It seems that no new MIDIs with large note counts. Maybe, it is a pretty busy month so I'm not always watching the server. Anyways, here it is. The current count of the list is 312 songs from 301 songs ( 11 additions), 133 additions from the latest wiki revision (179). Here are some of the new additions. A new version of Funky Stars by ooo 000 LBSFS Andromeda Mode by LucasMIDI A bunch of Two Faced Lovers merges by PianoEclipse A bunch of * Bad Apple from various blackers. I tried to implement categories on the table. It is kind of vague so any suggestion would be appreciated. Over 212 songs have been catalogued. Some are confusing than others. You may contribute, by checking the spreadsheet or suggesting songs, and please update the wiki page, BMT. (high hopes?) Thanks for reading. Click here to see the message on Discord. Click here to see the changelog. Second April 2019 Update (26 April 2019) Hello, it's time for another update, but we need to talk about something . On this update, there are two new 93 trillion MIDIs. Counting a new 93 trillion MIDI on the last update, that's three 93 trillion MIDIs in 2019. This might be a good sign, but also a bad sign. Yes, it is a double-edged sword. On the other side, this proves that the community proves that creating large MIDIs are a lot easier compared to the last years. But, this also proves that you can make low-quality MIDIs with ultra-inflated note quantities. One of the new MIDIs on the list, Bad Apple RTX by ooo 000 and Charlie Yan, got itself quite a controversy. The note count? 2.198.553.505.690. Yes, two trillion notes, such an unbelievable note count, kind of expected from two members that are known for their large MIDIs. The notes are actually cramped in a single and short crash point, making it impossible to pass, if you can play it in real-time. It's not like those art spam by ooo 000 or Emex or huge merges like Decimation Mode. It's just a crash point. Seriously, a lot of people got mad about it. So, what am I going to do with it, along with some of the large songs? My final decision is to keep adding those songs to the list . The reason is that I try to not do any bias on the list. If someone wants to do a large MIDI, just go ahead and put it. If I can, I will add it, as long as it is abiding by the guidelines. Yes, it is easy to make large MIDIs, as I said before. But, I think it's just unethical to do so, trying to inflate the list with some low-quality songs. It is a moral decision of someone to make large MIDIs, not me. So, I'll tell you again, I will add it to the list, okay? Of course, the people who can edit the wiki page, like Keppy or the BMT members, have a final decision on updating the list on the wiki page .

Sorry for the huge delay, the list is done weeks ago but school somehow kept me busy at these times to upload it. It's such a pain. Also, I'm focusing at other things. 13 new songs, from 378 to 391 , some of which are... Ouranos by HDSQ and The Romanticist Ievan's Polka Infinite Star Wars and War of Sky City by Charile Yan and ooo 000. Various versions of YIAY Lag Tester by me and AwesomeGamer89 By the way, Ievan's Polka Infinite Star Wars became is now the largest non-experimental MIDI , while Happy Theme of DEATH V10 is the largest legit MIDI . The reason why is most of Ievan's Polka Infinity Star Wars notes has no note-off event. Also, the limit of the legit MIDI is estimated as 46,9 trillion notes, because each note need to have a note-on event and a note-off event.

To be fair, this is the one of the lazy updates that I ever done on this. It seems that no new MIDIs with large note counts. Maybe, it is a pretty busy month so I'm not always watching the server. Anyways, here it is. The current count of the list is 312 songs from 301 songs ( 11 additions), 133 additions from the latest wiki revision (179). Here are some of the new additions. A new version of Funky Stars by ooo 000 LBSFS Andromeda Mode by LucasMIDI A bunch of Two Faced Lovers merges by PianoEclipse A bunch of * Bad Apple from various blackers. I tried to implement categories on the table. It is kind of vague so any suggestion would be appreciated. Over 212 songs have been catalogued. Some are confusing than others.

On this update, there are two new 93 trillion MIDIs. Counting a new 93 trillion MIDI on the last update, that's three 93 trillion MIDIs in 2019. This might be a good sign, but also a bad sign. Yes, it is a double-edged sword. On the other side, this proves that the community proves that creating large MIDIs are a lot easier compared to the last years. But, this also proves that you can make low-quality MIDIs with ultra-inflated note quantities. One of the new MIDIs on the list, Bad Apple RTX by ooo 000 and Charlie Yan, got itself quite a controversy. The note count? 2.198.553.505.690. Yes, two trillion notes, such an unbelievable note count, kind of expected from two members that are known for their large MIDIs. The notes are actually cramped in a single and short crash point, making it impossible to pass, if you can play it in real-time. It's not like those art spam by ooo 000 or Emex or huge merges like Decimation Mode. It's just a crash point. Seriously, a lot of people got mad about it. So, what am I going to do with it, along with some of the large songs? My final decision is to keep adding those songs to the list . The reason is that I try to not do any bias on the list. If someone wants to do a large MIDI, just go ahead and put it. If I can, I will add it, as long as it is abiding by the guidelines. Yes, it is easy to make large MIDIs, as I said before. But, I think it's just unethical to do so, trying to inflate the list with some low-quality songs. It is a moral decision of someone to make large MIDIs, not me. So, I'll tell you again, I will add it to the list, okay? Of course, the people who can edit the wiki page, like Keppy or the BMT members, have a final decision on updating the list on the wiki page . It is their own right to do so, and I'm not complaining about it. They can also ask me to remove it from the list, but for now, I'll keep adding the songs. Please don't hate me. Please...
